> Also known as [@denoverse/lang](https://jsr.io/@denoverse/lang) and [x/lang](https://deno.land/x/lang).

[![JSR @denoverse](https://jsr.io/badges/@denoverse)](https://jsr.io/@denoverse)

**deno_lang** is a library-agnostic collection of language utilities for [Deno](https://deno.com) and [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) â€” a nerdy homage to classics like [MooTools](https://mootools.net) and [mout](https://github.com/mout/mout)/[lang](https://github.com/mout/mout/tree/v1.2.4/src/lang). Check out the [history](repository-history-url) if you're curious about the backstory.

Sure, there are _different ways_ to do many of these things today. But this project was built with love, a strong focus on performance, and an API that's meant to feel as idiomatic as possible. ðŸš€

Weâ€™re happy if you have fun with it â€” and yeah, weâ€™re a little nostalgic about the good old days too.

## Getting started

### Installation

Add this package as a dependency to your project:

```sh
deno add jsr:@denoverse/lang
```

Then, import it in your code:

```ts
import { instanceOf } from "@denoverse/lang";
```

Alternatively, you can import deno_lang via [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x):

```ts
import { typeOf } from "https://deno.land/x/lang/mod.ts";
```

That said, we recommend using [JSR](https://jsr.io) as the future-proof standard for imports.

### Usage

Embrace the legacy of our forefathers â€” now with full TypeScript support:

```ts
import { hasTag, instanceOf, isConstructor, isType, typeOf } from "@denoverse/lang";

hasTag(123, "Number"); // true
instanceOf(true, Boolean); // true, works with primitives
isConstructor(() => {}); // false, must be newable
typeOf(null) === "object"; // false - it's "null"

const message = "Howdy!" as unknown;

// Type Guards FTW!
if (isType(message, "string")) {
  // message is now typed as string in TypeScript
} else {
  // message is still typed as unknown
}
```
