**deno_lang** is a library-agnostic collection of language utilities for Deno and TypeScript ‚Äî a nerdy homage to
classics like [MooTools](https://mootools.net) and
[mout](https://github.com/mout/mout)/[lang](https://github.com/mout/mout/tree/v1.2.4/src/lang). Check out our
[backstory][repository-history-url] if you‚Äôre curious about the history behind this package.

Sure, there are _different ways_ to do many of these things today ‚Äî in most cases, TypeScript handles it statically. But
when you need type safety at runtime, this still comes in handy. That said, this project was built with love, a strong
focus on performance, and an API that‚Äôs meant to feel as idiomatic as possible. üöÄ

We‚Äôre happy if you have fun with it ‚Äî and yeah, we‚Äôre a little nostalgic about the good old days too.

## Getting started

### Installation

Add this package as a dependency to your project:

```sh
deno add jsr:@denoverse/lang
```

Then, import it in your code:

```ts
import { instanceOf } from "@denoverse/lang";
```

Alternatively, you can import deno_lang via [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x):

```ts
import { typeOf } from "https://deno.land/x/lang/mod.ts";
```

We recommend using [JSR](https://jsr.io) as the future-proof standard for imports.

### Usage

Embrace the legacy of our forefathers ‚Äî now with full TypeScript support:

```ts
import { hasTag, instanceOf, isConstructor, isType, typeOf } from "@denoverse/lang";

hasTag(123, "Number"); // `true`
instanceOf(true, Boolean); // `true`, works with primitives
isConstructor(() => {}); // `false`, must be newable
typeOf(null) === "object"; // `false` - it's `"null"`

const message = "Howdy!" as unknown;

// Type Guards FTW!
if (isType(message, "string")) {
  // `message` now has type `string` in TypeScript
} else {
  // `message` is still typed as `unknown`
}
```
