**deno_lang** is a library-agnostic collection of language utilities for Deno and TypeScript — a nerdy homage to
classics like [MooTools](https://mootools.net) and
[mout](https://github.com/mout/mout)/[lang](https://github.com/mout/mout/tree/v1.2.4/src/lang). Check out our
[backstory][repository-history-url] if you’re curious about the history behind this package.

Sure, there are _different ways_ to do many of these things today — in most cases, TypeScript handles it statically. But
when you need type safety at runtime, this still comes in handy. That said, this project was built with love, a strong
focus on performance, and an API that’s meant to feel as idiomatic as possible. 🚀

We’re happy if you have fun with it — and yeah, we’re a little nostalgic about the good old days too.

## Getting started

### Installation

Add this package as a dependency to your project:

```sh
deno add jsr:@denoverse/lang
```

Then, import it in your code:

```ts
import { instanceOf } from "@denoverse/lang";
```

Alternatively, you can import deno_lang via [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x):

```ts
import { typeOf } from "https://deno.land/x/lang/mod.ts";
```

We recommend using [JSR](https://jsr.io) as the future-proof standard for imports.

### Usage

Embrace the legacy of our forefathers — now with full TypeScript support:

```ts
import { hasTag, instanceOf, isConstructor, isType, typeOf } from "@denoverse/lang";

hasTag(123, "Number"); // `true`
instanceOf(true, Boolean); // `true`, works with primitives
isConstructor(() => {}); // `false`, must be newable
typeOf(null) === "object"; // `false` - it's `"null"`

const message = "Howdy!" as unknown;

// Type Guards FTW!
if (isType(message, "string")) {
  // `message` now has type `string` in TypeScript
} else {
  // `message` is still typed as `unknown`
}
```
